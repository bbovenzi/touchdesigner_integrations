API integrations of Twitter, Instagram, Twilio and Sendgrid for TouchDesigner

Oddly enough it seems that the best way to run these are to run them as a separate script and read/write text files to a folder that the script and TouchDesigner both have access to.

Note: Twilio and Sendgrid are not yet upto date.
